1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,672
<i>This is Russo.
Please leave a message.</i>

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,439
He's not
answering my calls.

3
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,751
It's over,
and he must know it.

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,038
You don't think
there's any way
he can recover?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,600
The Republicans will
play that interview

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,234
on every radio
and television station

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,358
from now until
November 5th.

8
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,319
I sympathize with the kid,
but this was my concern
from the beginning.

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,790
And I should've
listened to you, sir.

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,349
I thought he could
handle the pressure.

11
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,030
Okay. So he withdraws.
We need to replace him.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,351
You have any ideas?

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,830
With less than
two months to go?

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,357
If the President hadn't
shut me out of
the early discussions,

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,631
I could've come up
with some good options,

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,949
but I don't know
anyone who's got

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
the name recognition
and donor base

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,952
to start a campaign
from scratch just
seven weeks out.

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,271
Let me think.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,753
Everything hinges on
the next few minutes.

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,311
All my months of planning,
every move I've made.

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,714
There is one person.

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Who?

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,189
You, Mr. Vice President.

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,232
If you ran to
reclaim your seat,

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,278
I think you'd
win by a landslide.

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,919
Resign the Vice Presidency?

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,310
Only if you win.

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,232
Walker needs me for 2016.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,759
Are you entirely certain
he's gonna keep
you on the ticket?

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,435
I mean, it's no secret

32
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,194
the two of you
don't exactly get along.

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,713
What has he said?

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,358
Oh, you're putting me in
a very awkward position,
Mr. Vice President.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
Has he been
bad-mouthing me?

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,393
Well, the exact
phrase he used was
"pain in the ass."

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,270
That fucker.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,712
He's got no idea
how to lead,
no sense of respect.

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,034
Is this his idea?
No.

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,156
His way of
getting rid of me?

41
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,350
No. It struck me
yesterday,

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,073
and I just thought it
was worth suggesting.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,879
But, no, I haven't
discussed this with anyone.

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,030
And you shouldn't.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,557
People don't leave
the White House to
become a governor.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,316
May I ask you
a personal question, sir?

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,791
Do you want to be
the Vice President?

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
Peter said that
when you were out
on that campaign trail,

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,315
you had so much
enthusiasm and energy

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,758
that he thought you maybe
missed being the Governor.

51
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,596
I do miss it.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,996
Then why not go back?

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,318
You could be the hero
of this election

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,715
and secure Pennsylvania
for the Democrats in 2016.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,152
Garrett would never
go along with
something like this,

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,469
even if he hates my guts.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,198
It would make him look weak,
like he's lost control
of the administration.

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,590
Not if it was
a mutual decision.

59
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,232
Look, let me talk to Garrett.
I won't mention
that we've spoken.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,434
I suppose there's
no harm in finding out
what he thinks.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,640

Mr. Vice President.

On the train ride down,

74
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,159
I almost called the police
to have them break in

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,835
and make sure you
hadn't hurt yourself.

76
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,070
I'm not even gonna
ask you what happened.
It doesn't matter right now.

77
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,311
What matters right now...

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,278
What matters...
Who is Goldwater?

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,594
<i>Claudia.

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,750

Oh, come on.
Hey, I'm watching that.

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,958
What matters is
the 50 reporters
in front of your building

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,437
and the 150 campaign staffers
who don't know
if they still have a job.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
It's over.

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,991
I know.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,595
So, tell them to go away.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,359
What, are you just
gonna hole yourself
up in here

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,396
and hope it all goes away?

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,039
Yeah, that's pretty much
the plan.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,349
Well, I won't let you.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,956
Hey, put that down. Hey.

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,600
Hey, put that down!

95
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,949
Peter...

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
We need to put out
a statement.

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,239
Call me when you're
prepared to do that.

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,599
I'll be at
the headquarters in Philly.

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,875
I was scared that
I was starting to feel
too much for you.

100
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,039
I think,
that's why I ended it.

101
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,032
And you have
no room for fear?

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,919
No. Being afraid doesn't
accomplish anything.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,435
It's not true.
When I'm overseas,

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,950
rational fear of
disease or violence,

105
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,555
that sort of fear
keeps you alive.

106
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,510
Back here, God,
I find myself
afraid of things

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,116
that I can't name
or point to.

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,796
It's like,
how little am I seeing?

109
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,430
Or have I wasted
this day or this moment?

110
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,435
Yeah, I think that sometimes,
whether my life will add up.

111
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,195
Francis would roll his eyes
if he heard me
talking like this.

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,877
Does he know
where you are?

113
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,311
No, he doesn't.

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,200
If he's looking for you,
that's where you are.

115
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,316
Over there.

116
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,797
Before you met Frank.

117
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,800
Alone.

118
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,798
Curious.

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,276
Absorbing everything.

120
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,751
You have no idea
what I was like
when I was a girl.

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,111
Did he ever know
that side of you?

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,392
He wasn't interested
in that girl.

123
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,550
And neither was I.

124
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,830
What were you
interested in?

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,716
Being more
than an observer.

126
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,759
You wanted to be seen.

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,273
Not just seen.

128
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,353
I wanted to be significant.

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,835
There's no
historical precedent.

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,990
Aaron Burr ran for governor,
Calhoun for the Senate.

131
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,311
Two hundred years ago.
One shot a man in a duel,

132
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
the other believed
in slavery.

133
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,031
Is that really the sort
of company we want
to share, Frank?

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,352
Mr. President, we stand
losing control of
an important swing state,

135
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,794
our majority in the House,

136
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,917
and quite possibly your
second term in office.

137
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,114
Preventing all of that
may require unconventional
measures.

138
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,270
It would look like
I'm pushing him out.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,959
Or worse,
that he's abandoning
the administration.

140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,193
You make a joint statement.

141
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,596
You say he won't
resign unless he wins.

142
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,760
If he loses, he stays
on as Vice President.

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,277
No one could accuse
either of you
of disloyalty to the other.

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,635
Did Jim come
to you with this?

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
No. It's entirely
my idea.

146
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
I wouldn't dream of speaking
to the Vice President

147
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,240
without passing it
by you first.

148
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,118
I think he'd take
it as an affront,

149
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,755
like I'm trying
to get rid of him.

150
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,473
Honestly, sir,
I think he might be

151
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,279
more interested
than you imagine.

152
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,315
Why is that?

153
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,590
Well, I hesitate
to bring this up,

154
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,997
but when he was
campaigning for Russo,

155
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,317
he spoke quite
freely about you, sir.

156
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,911
Tell me.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,832
Of course, I'm getting
this secondhand from Peter,

158
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,956
but the gist of it
is that...

159
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,356
That you lack
entirely in leadership,

160
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,793
and that you have
no sense of respect.

161
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,519
And he wants
more responsibility?

162
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,078
And how do I give him
that when he shows

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,112
absolutely no discretion,
no discipline?

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,192
Well, that is
entirely my point.
Now, look,

165
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,397
I take full responsibility
for backing Russo,

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,075
but there could be
a silver lining in all this.

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,958
You could
accomplish two goals.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,191
Secure Pennsylvania
for the Democrats

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,832
and find an honorable way
to replace Matthews.

170
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,350
What do you think?

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,793
I think it is
a very big decision,

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,718
and we do not want to
make it impulsively.

173
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,190
I agree.
I'd like to put some
more thought into it.

174
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,192
Well, that is
very prudent, sir.
Just bear in mind,

175
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,431
seven weeks out,
that every day counts.

176
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,190
Hi, sir.

177
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,310
How much is it?

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,995
Oh, I got your
receipt right here.

179
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,954
No, no, no.
It was just $40.

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,871
Yeah.
Don't tell anyone,
all right?

181
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,790
No. I never say
anything about our tenants.

182
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,513
The press still outside?
Yeah.

183
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,557
I told them
you weren't here,
like you said.

184
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,519
Most of them left.
There's still a few, though.

185
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,875
If I wanted to leave,
is there a place

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,314
I could do it
without being seen?

187
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,591
Yeah. The freight elevator
down to the garage.

188
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,714
I could call you
a cab or...

189
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,433
All right. Thanks.
I'll let you know.

190
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,631
Mr. Russo...

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,952
Sir, it's none
of my business,

192
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,191
but my uncle,
he fell off
the wagon a few times.

193
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,920
When he did,
the best thing for him
was just not to be alone.

194
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,316
I'll give you this money back,
I'll take that
bag off your hands,

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
come in here,
keep you company...

196
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,760
I appreciate it.
I'll let you know
if I change my mind.

197
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,311
Sit down.

198
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,315
Where's Claire?

199
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,560
Not here.

200
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,959
So what is this,
tying up loose ends?

201
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,834
I wouldn't presume.
People like you
can't be neatly tied up.

202
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,912
But I thought
perhaps we could start...

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,589
It's very tasteful.

204
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,393
This is the dress
she wore to the gala.

205
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,233
I believe so.

206
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,118
It is.

207
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,757
I recognize it.

208
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,310
Go back
into the bedroom.

209
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,837
I'm amazed how well
you got her in focus.

210
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,510
What should we call her?

211
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,630
Why does she
need a name?

212
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,799
I never photograph anyone
without knowing their name.

213
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,714
You didn't take
the photograph. I did.

214
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,711
I think we should
call her Claire.

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,952
She doesn't even
look like me.

216
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,271
Not even a younger version.
Why do you keep saying that?

217
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,273
Not her features,
her expression.

218
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,194
Hey, we should mount it.
You can hang her
in your house.

219
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,556
Would Francis object?

220
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,118
Can we please not
discuss Francis?

221
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,835
You brought him up
in the park.

222
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,991
I know I did,
and I shouldn't have.

223
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,754
So we have to pretend
he doesn't exist?

224
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,831
I thought we could
talk about anything.

225
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,319
He is a presence here.
You must admit that.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,196
When you walked
through the door yesterday,

227
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,795
he walked right in
with you.

228
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,189
It's just me,
nobody else.

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,512
You keep
telling yourself that,
it might come true.

230
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,952
How do you think
she'd feel if she knew
I was wearing this?

231
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,231
I don't know.

232
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,794
You don't think
she'd be upset?

233
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,949
She'd probably say
you look very
beautiful in it.

234
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,476
It's like steel.

235
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,518
You should put it back.

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,633
I think I'll keep it.

237
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,872
I'll buy you one of
your own, if you'd like.

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,595
No. I want this one.

239
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,435
She came into my bedroom.
She should know
I came into hers.

240
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,920
Is your bed always
so perfectly made?

241
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,037
It's a habit I formed
at military school.

242
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,392
What side of the bed
does she sleep on?

243
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,793
That side.

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,276
She can keep it.

245
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,037
Fits her better anyway.

246
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,757
Listen, Zoe...

247
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,111
Whatever just
happened upstairs,

248
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,357
whatever these past
six months have been,

249
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,990
can we agree that it
is time to simplify?

250
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,313
What does simple
look like?

251
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
We maintain our
professional arrangement,

252
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,277
as you suggested,
which I will honor.

253
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,474
You still trust me?

254
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,116
What choice do I have?

255
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,232
You didn't hurt me
or discard me like
you said you would.

256
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,599
I'm glad I didn't have to.

257
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,431
Yes, we'll agree
to simplify.

258
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,638
Good.

259
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,677
<i>Sorry I'm a few
minutes late, Frank.</i>

260
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,953
Please, have a seat.

261
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,154
I have a pretty good idea
why you asked
for this meeting.

262
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,833
Have you and the President
had a chance to speak?

263
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,400
We have.

264
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,233
Is he leaning
one way or another?

265
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,436
He's torn.

266
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,398
And what about you?
I'm a little less torn.

267
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
My instincts tell me
it's a mistake.

268
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
You want to
convince me otherwise?

269
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,153
Well, look,
if your instincts tell you

270
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,674
this is not the way to go,
I'm not about to...

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,070
Frank, I'm gonna ask you
two very direct questions,

272
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,510
and I would appreciate
direct answers.

273
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,917
When you got
my son into college,

274
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,037
were you anticipating
a moment like this?

275
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,350
I don't follow.

276
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,510
Honestly, Frank?

277
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,958
Was I antici...

278
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,389
I would be happy to answer you
directly if I knew
what you were asking.

279
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,076
All right. I will ask
you my second question.

280
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,718
Do you want the
Vice Presidency
for yourself?

281
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,157
I would serve at the pleasure
of the President.
If that was his...

282
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,756
You proposed this idea
so that you can
take Matthews' place.

283
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,712
I did not say that.
But it is
what you want.

284
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,635
What I want is in the...

285
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,955
The President
makes you VP,

286
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,872
he keeps you on
the ticket in 2016,

287
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,350
and you use that
as a springboard
to run in 2020.

288
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,598
Tell me that trajectory
has never entered your mind.

289
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,873
Well, Linda,
I make a habit of

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,390
considering all trajectories
in any given situation.

291
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,917
But that's
a practical exercise,
not a personal one.

292
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,155
So you refuse
to admit it.

293
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,152
Admit it's what I want?
That's irrelevant.

294
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,232
You're the one who asked
for this meeting, not me.

295
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,152
This meeting's about
trying to solve a problem,

296
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,311
not fulfill some
personal ambition.

297
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,950
But if both could
be achieved,
you wouldn't object.

298
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,672
I think this is
a sound course of action

299
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,197
regardless of
who the President
taps to replace Matthews.

300
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,876
I must gamble
everything I have right now.

301
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,519
If I'm honest,
she may use it against me.

302
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,672
If I'm not,
she won't lift a finger.

303
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,877
I've used this
same tactic myself.

304
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,435
Once someone is exposed,
they're at your mercy.

305
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,432
She wants to hear me
say the words.

306
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,918
Yes.

307
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,953
I want to be
the Vice President.

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,720
And, yes, I helped
your son get into college

309
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,560
in the hopes that you
would return the favor.

310
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,633
But I can't force
you to do so, Linda.

311
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,599
But I also think that
we would make
a formidable team.

312
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,869
Look what we've
been able to accomplish

313
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,759
even when we've been
at odds with each other.

314
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,550
Now put your mind
to what we could
accomplish if we weren't.

315
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
Thank you for
taking the time, Linda.

316
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,551
I'll call you back.
How'd it go?

317
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,950
She's holding her cards
very close to the chest.

318
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,430
Any word from Peter?
Nothing.

319
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
Christina said he wouldn't
leave the apartment.

320
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,071
But I called the doorman,
and he said that
Peter was gone.

321
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,674
Where?
He doesn't know.

322
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,400
He needs to officially
withdraw to put
pressure on Walker.

323
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,755
I'm trying
to track him down.

324
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,433
Why'd you let him
out of your sight
in the first place?

325
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,636
I thought he
was showering.

326
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,995
He disappeared when I was
on the phone with you.

327
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,472
There was a plan here, Doug.
He explodes, he withdraws,

328
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,792
we put him back together,
and he quietly goes away.

329
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,997
<i>Russo has made
no public appearances</i>

330
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,112
<i>since allegations
that he was inebriated</i>

331
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,399
<i>during a radio interview
on WZPZ Pittsburgh
yesterday morning.</i>

332
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
<i>Sources among
the Democratic
leadership have suggested</i>

333
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,591
<i>that the party is
currently considering
options to replace Russo.</i>

334
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,593
<i>Meanwhile,
Republican candidate
Jack Swofford's lead</i>

335
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,797
<i>has jumped to
a 24-point margin,</i>

336
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,554
<i>according to an overnight
CNN poll of registered voters.</i>

337
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,632
<i>The Swofford campaign
is also reporting</i>

338
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,752
<i>a sharp spike

339
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,560
<i>Nearly $500,000

340
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,757
I saw that this morning.

341
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,678
Francis got Peter to run.

342
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,315
Do you know him well?

343
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,754
We weren't close.

344
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,157
Do you need to make calls?
'Cause I can head
into the other room.

345
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,755
I don't think so. Thanks.

346
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,270
Where are you going?

347
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,955
To the lab.
I should've gone in today.

348
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,870
Adam.

349
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,912
Adam...
Just go. Go. Leave.

350
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,151
How long do you think this
can possibly go on for?

351
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,232
We have never spent more
than 48 hours together.

352
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,710
Maybe there's
a reason for that.

353
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,198
A part of me
still loves you.

354
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,794
Which part?

355
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,832
I can't be just
a pit stop, Claire,

356
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,236
or some sort of escape...
Oh, come on.
You're more than that.

357
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,118
Or a top-up on whatever
Francis can't provide.

358
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,398
Oh, fuck off!
He's my husband, Adam.

359
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,149
We've gone through more
than you could ever imagine.

360
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,038
I envy your free spirit,
and I'm attracted to it,

361
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,992
but not all of us
have that luxury.

362
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,551
Which is what I find
so frustrating
about you, Claire.

363
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,280
You had a choice.

364
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,192
You chose
not to be free.

365
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,079
No. What I chose was
a man I could love
for more than a week.

366
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,035
I shouldn't have
said that. I...

367
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,919
At least you're
being honest.

368
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,880
I can't live moment to
moment like you, Adam.

369
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,840
I have a history with Francis,
I have a future with him,

370
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,674
and it's bigger
than a moment.

371
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,760
Then you should kill it.

372
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,075
Whatever part of
you still loves me.

373
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,680
If you can't,

374
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,157
I will.

375
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,749
Adam...
No.

376
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,913
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

377
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,318
How's it going?
Are you with your mom?

378
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,551
<i>She's downstairs.
You want me to go get her?</i>

379
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,429
No. No. I just wanted
to call and say,

380
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,152
you know,
hey to your brother and you.

381
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,560
Is he there?

382
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,236
<i>He's in his room, I think.</i>

383
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,278
Okay. You want to
go get him?

384
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,430
<i>Hold on.</i>

385
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,873
<i>He says he doesn't
want to talk to you.</i>

386
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,750
Why not?

387
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,036
<i>We've seen the news, Dad.</i>

388
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,839
<i>There were all sorts of
TV cameras at our
school yesterday.</i>

389
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,152
<i>Mom's making us
stay home this week.</i>

390
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,672
I want you to do something.
I want you to go to

391
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,992
your bedroom
window and look out.

392
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,871
You see that black car?

393
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,510
<i>Yeah.</i>

394
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,790
That's me.

395
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,510
<i>You shouldn't be here, Dad.
Mom would be really angry.</i>

396
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,839
Well, we don't need
to tell her. Right?

397
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,911
It'll just be...
It'll just be...

398
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,910
It'll just be
our little secret.

399
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,516
<i>Your voice sounds weird,
like it did on the radio.</i>

400
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,232
You heard that?

401
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,551
<i>I have a computer.</i>

402
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,998
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,076
Sometimes your dad
makes mistakes.

404
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,879
<i>I better go.</i>
No.

405
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,680
<i>I don't like to hear
your voice when
it's like this.</i>

406
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,600
<i>It makes me sad.
Bye, Dad.</i>

407
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,797
Sarah, please...

408
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,677
<i>Peter?</i>

409
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,274
Christina.

410
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,636
<i>Where are you?</i>

411
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,712
I'm...

412
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,354
I'm not doing so well.

413
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,557
<i>Where are you, Peter?</i>

414
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,074
I'm in my car.

415
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,720
<i>Are you driving?</i>

416
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,155
No.

417
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,959
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

418
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,357
I'm outside my kids' house.

419
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,477
<i>You mean
Madeleine's?</i>
Yeah.

420
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,474
<i>I need you to stay
right there. Okay, Peter?</i>

421
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,313
<i>You'll stay there?</i>

422
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,958
<i>Peter.</i>

423
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,430
<i>Peter,
are you still there?</i>

424
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,233
<i>Hello?</i>

425
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,914
<i>Hello?</i>

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,832
I'd like to turn myself in.

427
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,997
For what?

428
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,670
A few months ago,

429
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,992
I was pulled over
for drunk driving.

430
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,151
They let me go.
I should've been convicted.

431
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,430
Well, if you were let go,
sir, we can't arrest
you for it now.

432
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,795
Well, I drunk drove here.
Arrest me for that.

433
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,154
We can put you
in a detox tank...

434
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,914
I want to be
formally arrested.

435
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,072
My name is
Congressman Peter Russo.

436
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,754
I was arrested in January
on Michigan Avenue.

437
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,276
Please have a seat,
Congressman.

438
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,676
I gotta make
a few phone calls.

439
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,120
- Have you found him?
<i>- I'm in front of
his ex-wife's house.</i>

440
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,714
But Christina said
he called from there.

441
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
<i>He's not there?</i>

442
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,674
No.

443
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,315
But his phone is.
I found it by the curb.

444
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,034
So we have no
way to contact him?

445
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,510
<i>Not unless he
reaches out to us.</i>

446
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,756
This isn't good.

447
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,950
<i>Want me to alert
the authorities?</i>

448
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,400
Let's give him
a little longer.

449
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,439
How long
did it last?
About six months.

450
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,236
He was older.

451
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,516
A lot?

452
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,040
Yeah.

453
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,477
Was he a journalist,
or did he work on the Hill?

454
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,597
I'd rather not say.

455
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,271
All right.

456
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,353
He was someone
I looked up to
for a while.

457
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,517
Why did it end?

458
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,960
He has a wife.

459
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,794
We both knew it was
going to end eventually.

460
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,117
I mean,
it was really...

461
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,752
It was fucked up.

462
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,194
The first night
we spent together,

463
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,590
he told me he was
gonna hurt me
and then discard me.

464
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,111
And when it ended,
I told him that
he'd done neither.

465
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,671
But it does hurt.

466
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,836
I won't hurt you.

467
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,632
Yeah, you can't
promise me that.

468
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,399
Yes, I can.

469
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,714
Has anyone
else seen him?

470
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,234
No.

471
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,391
He's in an interrogation
room by himself.

472
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,833
I never should've got
mixed up in this fucking mess.

473
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,117
We're way behind
regret time, Barney.

474
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,519
Just have your guys
keep him out of sight.

475
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,796
I'll need
a back exit.

476
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,158
I got him. Thanks.
Yeah.

477
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,720
Come on.

478
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,678
Hey, Peter.

479
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,877
Where's your car?

480
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,594
It's down the street.

481
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,151
I'll drive you home.
You go back to mine,
have Meechum let you in.

482
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,516
This way?
Yeah.

483
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,794
<i>What were you
thinking, Peter?</i>

484
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,158
I need to take
responsibility
for my actions.

485
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,959
By getting yourself
thrown in jail?

486
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,952
Real responsibility.

487
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,160
Like they talk
about in the meetings,

488
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,754
not the lies we
told for the campaign.

489
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,072
What you just did
was extremely reckless.

490
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,277
I don't care.

491
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,478
I'm making a statement
tomorrow, Frank.

492
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,911
About pulling
out of the race?

493
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,036
That's not enough. I...

494
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,035
I need to stop hiding.

495
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,557
Well, let's work
together on the language.

496
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,394
I have to do it on my own.
It's gotta be in my own words.

497
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,154
Look, Peter,
this isn't just about
you anymore, all right?

498
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,392
Let me help you.
I don't want your help.

499
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,789
I didn't ever ask your help
when I got arrested.

500
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,314
When has your
help ever helped me?

501
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,951
You can live your
life the way you want to.

502
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,794
I'm done being
told how to live mine.

503
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,796
Well, there has to be
a way to take responsibility

504
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,556
without shattering everything.

505
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,672
Are you at least willing
to have that discussion?

506
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,470
Do you want me
to come upstairs?

507
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,994
No.

508
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,511
I know you're in
a lot of pain, Peter.

509
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,752
But I don't want you to
feel any pain tonight.

510
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,189
Here. You can
start fresh tomorrow.

511
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,195
Go ahead. I won't judge you.
Hell, I'll even join you.

512
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,877
Just relax.

513
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,397
You're home now.

514
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,152
Whatever it is you
have to face tomorrow,

515
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,675
you don't have to
face it now.

516
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,154
Right now,
it's just you and me.

517
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,994
The rest of the world
doesn't matter.

518
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,994
Your children,
Christina,

519
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,151
they will forgive you,

520
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,399
because you're loved,
Peter.

521
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,597
Failed.

522
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,676
I failed myself.

523
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,275
I failed my family.

524
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,080
I failed the campaign.

525
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,431
No, you haven't, Peter.

526
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,231
May I?

527
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,158
You know,
when Claire and I
were first married,

528
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,597
we talked about
having children.

529
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,360
I told her flat out
I didn't want any.

530
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,070
It was selfish
but honest.

531
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,075
I didn't have
a particularly
happy childhood.

532
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,311
I suspect
you didn't either.

533
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,629
No.

534
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,229
You see, no person
avoids pain.

535
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,993
And I just didn't
think it was right

536
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,833
to bring a child
in knowing that.

537
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,516
But now when
I think back, I...

538
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,394
I realize that
was cowardly.

539
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,232
I see you,

540
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,039
and I think, well,
there's a brave man,
far braver than me.

541
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,994
I'm so tired.

542
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,354
When I think
about...

543
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm so tired.

544
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,880
You should
close your eyes.

545
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,350
Let it all go.

546
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,357
We have all
the time in the world.

547
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,713
Peter?

548
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,237
Peter.

549
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,074
I walked back.

550
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,155
Whatever happens in
the next few hours,

551
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,516
whatever you hear,

552
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,116
we will never
speak of it.

553
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,237
Sir...

554
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
I heard from Linda
about a half an hour ago.

555
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,112
The President
wants to meet with you.

556
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,038
8:30.

557
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,676
About what?

558
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,195
I don't know.

559
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,590
Frank.

560
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,874
You know, when you
brought up this idea,
I wasn't sold.

561
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,193
It struck me as both
desperate and careless.

562
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,590
But then Linda
laid out all the pros,

563
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,512
and they clearly
outweigh the cons.

564
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,317
I explained our
reasoning to Jim and hoped

565
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,352
he wouldn't think
I was off my rocker.

566
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,831
I did at first,
but the President made
some very good arguments.

567
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,197
It's a bold move, Frank.
I'm very impressed.

568
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,715
Well, thank you, sir,
for being open to the idea.

569
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,679
And thank you,

Mr. President,

for taking the risk.


570
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,359
We'll need to work
this out step-by-step.

571
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,630
The execution
has to be perfect.

572
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,950
Where are things
with Russo?

573
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,030
Any word from him yet?

574
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,116
We're still
trying to locate him.

575
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,232
Well, is there
any cause for worry?
It's been two days.

576
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,913
I am a bit worried,
I have to admit.

577
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,674
I mean, this must be
an extremely
difficult moment for him.

578
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,314
We're hoping he'll
reach out shortly.

579
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,194
Let's get our people on it.
I want to know where he is.

580
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,237
Now, once he withdraws,
we have to move quickly.

581
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,829
We'll make a joint statement,
as you proposed.

582
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,079
It's a clear message,
I think.





584
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,000
That's right.
I'll say that Jim's

585
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,600
an invaluable asset
to the White House,

586
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,275
but that I have great
admiration for the sacrifice

587
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,192
he's willing to make for
the people of his home state.

588
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,954
And you should not accept
his resignation
until he's elected.

590
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,394
I think that's
a very good idea.

591
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,949
As long as I can
devote myself wholly to
the campaign, I agree.

592
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,474
Now, should Jim win,
we'll need to

593
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,114
nominate a Vice
President immediately.

594
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,953
Linda, are you putting
together a list of names?

595
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,679
Yes. And you can begin
the vetting process

596
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,439
as soon as you
narrow down the choices.

597
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,552
I already have
a short list
of top contenders.

598
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,875
I want your
input on that, Jim.

599
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,269
More than happy.

600
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,592
Congressman?

601
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,354
Congressman?

602
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,992
We can use
the existing infrastructure.

603
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,719
Are you okay
with Nash Aarons?

604
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,600
I like Nash, but I'll
want to bring in some
of my own people.

605
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,916
Well, that won't
be a problem.
Nash is a team player.

606
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,514
And we can reallocate
some of your

607
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,194
existing 2016
reelection funds...

608
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,391
Excuse me. Linda.

609
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,551
Peter Russo is dead.

610
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,316
Suicide.

611
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,672
He was found in his garage
with the car still running.

612
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm so sorry, Frank.

613
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,320
May I have
a moment, sir?
Of course.

614
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,194
I will get more
information and start
drafting a statement.

615
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,114
Let's reschedule.
Whenever is best
for Frank.

616
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,556
<i>Congressman Peter Russo
was found dead</i>

617
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,552
<i>early this morning
in the parking garage...</i>

618
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,711
Why didn't
we break this?

619
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,520
<i>U. S. Secret Service Agents
discovered his body
after reports that</i>

620
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,716
<i>Russo had been
missing since Saturday.</i>

621
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,990
Fuck!

622
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>His body was transferred
to the D. C. Coroner's office</i>

623
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,917
<i>where an autopsy
is expected to confirm
his death as a suicide.</i>

624
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,032
<i>A junior congressman
from Philadelphia...</i>

625
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,396
<i>Russo was 36 years old...</i>
Zoe. Look at this.

626
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,836
<i>...and is survived
by two children.</i>

627
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,593
I gotta get
to the office.

628
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,473
<i>Russo was in the midst
of a heated battle</i>

629
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,313
<i>for the governorship
of Pennsylvania.</i>

630
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,158
<i>He was last heard

631
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,920
<i>on Pittsburgh
station WZPZ.</i>

632

<i>Now, during the interview,</i>

633
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,072
<i>he slurred his words,
he sounded disoriented...</i>

634
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,197
Christina.
<i>...leading many to believe</i>

635
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,794
<i>that he had relapsed...</i>

636
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,434
Can you get me
a train back to D.C.?

637
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,831
<i>Right here on this
TV station for all your

Congressman Peter Russo.</i>

639
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,633

642
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,154

643
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,750
<i>A sort of magnetic presence

644

<i>And my husband

646
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,000
<i>Peter was more
than a colleague,
more than a friend.</i>

647
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,591
<i>He was family.</i>

648
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,434
<i>Our hearts go

649
