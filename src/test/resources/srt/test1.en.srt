00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,830
Welcome to Polar Bear's Café!

2
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,880
Panda

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,970
Chilling and eating bamboo 
grass is the best thing ever.

4
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,290
Hey now.

5
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,300
Look at you, being so lazy 
so early in the day.

6
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,310
You're in the way of my cleaning.

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,500
Scoot.

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,840
Okay.

9
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,500
Seconds please, Mom.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,710
Exactly what do you have 
planned for your future?

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,930
Jeez...

12
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,850
Could we not talk about my future

13
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,230
when I'm relaxing?

14
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,100
If you have so much time to relax,

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,960
you could go look for a part-time job.

16
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm too busy relaxing, 
so I'll do it later.

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,710
Don't try to suck me up!

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,170
Jeez...

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,820
I wonder why Mom can't understand

20
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,130
how much time relaxing takes up.

21
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,770
Part Time Jobs!!

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,770
WORK KING

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,690
Excuse me,

24
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,170
which of these will have jobs

25
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,300
where I can get paid to do nothing?

26
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,260
I don't think there is one.

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,930
Really?

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,080
If I really have to work,

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,220
I'd prefer a really fancy job.

30
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,950
Oh!

31
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,630
This looks good.

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
Yes?

33
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,260
Oh, hi, my name is Panda.

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,000
You're advertising a part-time 
position for a designer, right?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes, we are.

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,890
Do you have experience?

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,670
No, none.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,040
Are you able to use a computer mouse?

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Not at all!

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm not very good with detailed work.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,310
I see.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,280
Do you have anything you're good at?

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes, I do!

44
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,390
I'm good at eating bamboo grass,

45
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,330
and zoning out while lying down.

46
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,430
Huh?  Hello?

47
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,180
Oh, hello?

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,320
You're also advertising a position for 
an interior coordinator, right?

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,180
Uh, yes.

50
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,680
What, exactly, is an 
interior coordinator?

51
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,570
There you are being lazy again.

52
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,550
Did you find a part-time job?

53
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,420
There aren't any!

54
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,150
Weren't there openings at 
the convenience store?

55
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,500
The convenience store?

56
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,990
They have too many things.

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,590
I won't be able to remember them all!

58
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,510
Don't try to suck me up!

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,840
Jeez.

60
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,740
I think I'll wander around outside.

61
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,890
Huh?  A string.

62
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,560
Could you get it?

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,900
Sure.

64
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Got it!

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,180
Thank you!

66
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,940
Oh my.

67
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,010
Stay right there.

68
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,190
Hey, wait!

69
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,840
Wow, I didn't know there 
was a café here.

70
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,130
Hello.

71
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,230
Welcome to Polar Bear's Café.

72
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,220
Table for one, sir?

73
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,750
Oh, well, I'm not exactly a custo—

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,410
Please have a seat anywhere you like.

75
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,030
O-Okay!

76
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,970
May I take your order?

77
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,950
Let's see...

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,910
Do you have bamboo?

79
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,030
We don't have any bamboo.

80
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,920
Then could I get bamboo grass?

81
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
We don't have bamboo grass either.

82
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,270
Then I'll have an iced coffee.

83
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,920
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,050
Hey, Polar Bear.

85
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,780
Do you ever get too many 
point cards in your wallet?

86
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,570
You collect points, Mr. Penguin?

87
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,020
Yep.  Oh, could I get 
another café mocha?

88
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,480
Seconds <i>(okawari)</i>.

89
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,980
What?

90
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,140
Those would be sunflowers <i>(himawari)</i>.

91
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,470
B Meal

92
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,110
That would be the 
daily special <i>(higawari)</i>.

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,090
That would be 
splitting logs <i>(makiwari)</i>.

94
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,410
That's splitting a watermelon <i>(suika wari)</i>.

95
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,920
Seconds, please.

96
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,090
Here's your café mocha.

97
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,370
You know, if it weren't for all 
the puns in this café...

98
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,210
By the way, I heard you were 
looking for a part-timer?

99
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,810
Yes, I'm short-staffed.

100
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,720
Are you interested, Mr. Penguin?

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,350
Who, me?

102
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,190
I wonder if I could handle being 
a customer and a part-timer.

103
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,370
Just kidding.  I have about 
four interviews lined up.

104
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,320
Oh.  And here I was 
actually considering it.

105
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,040
Could I have an interview, too?

106
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,040
I was also thinking of working part-time.

107
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,100
Would you like an interview?

108
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,460
What?!

109
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,790
Interview in Progress

110
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,190
Well then, will the first 
applicant please come up.

111
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,050
Yes!

112
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm Badger.

113
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,270
Let's see...  Would you be 
able to work the hall?

114
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,190
Yes!  You can leave the holes to me!

115
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm a pro at digging holes!

116
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,530
Er, "hall," not "hole."

117
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,740
Next applicant, please.

118
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,790
Here.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,660
I'm... Giant... Tortoise...

120
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,000
Are you able to carry orders?

121
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,920
Yes.

122
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,160
Here we go...

123
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,290
Definitely taking his time.

124
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,330
Please let me work about 
a hundred years.

125
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,640
Er, I don't think that'll be possible.

126
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm Mandrill.

127
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,960
I'm very good at eating.

128
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,440
Not exactly what we're looking for.

129
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,290
I'm Anteater.

130
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,740
I-I can intimidate!

131
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,100
That's it?

132
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,180
Seems so.

133
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,840
Will the last applicant step up, please.

134
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,970
Okay!

135
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,470
My name is Panda.

136
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,160
Nice to meet you.

137
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,590
Finally a decent candidate.

138
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,740
Is there anything you're 
good at, Panda?

139
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,570
Yes!

140
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,360
I'm very good at lying around 
and eating bamboo grass.

141
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,530
Huh?

142
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,250
Er, let's see...

143
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,180
Are there any specific conditions 
you'd like to request?

144
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,210
Two days a week, please.

145
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,820
Hm, you'd prefer two days?

146
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, you mean I could just 
work one day a week?

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
No, no.  I was hoping for 
at least four days a week.

148
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,350
I definitely can't do that.

149
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,430
Oh, but...

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,380
if you pick me up, I'll come right away.

151
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,080
I have to come and get you?

152
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,610
Oh, of course not.

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
Only if I'm late.

154
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,080
You have every intention 
of being late, don't you?

155
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,990
Just curious...

156
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,220
do you really intend to work?

157
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,780
Not really.

158
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,330
And the results are

159
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,260
none of you passed.

160
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,260
What?!

161
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,810
Are you really that surprised?

162
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,650
It seems, in the end...

163
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
...I wasn't able to find a part-timer.

164
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,440
That's too bad.

165
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,550
You're still here?!

166
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,240
If I go home, 
my mom will try to suck me up.

167
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,650
S-Suck you up?

168
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,680
Yep.  Like "whirrr."

169
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,210
Pardon me,

170
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,670
I hate to interrupt you 
during your interviews.

171
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,280
I would like to live in...

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm sorry, you fail.

173
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't think he meant 
a live-in employee.

174
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,750
I would like to live in your yard.

175
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,560
He asked me if I would 
bring him here.

176
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,690
What is your name, Miss?

177
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,630
Who, me?  It's Sasako.

178
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,640
Miss Sasako, you pass.

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,750
What?!

180
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:59,420
Polar 
 Bear's 
  Café

182
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,840
Hey, Mom.

184
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,650
I found a really neat café today.

185
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,520
It's called Polar Bear's Café.

186
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,560
What are you talking about?

187
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Of course I know about it.

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,810
Huh?  You do?

189
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,520
It's been there for a really long time.

190
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,490
Right next door to us.

191
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
What?!

192
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,820
Panda's Search for Employment.

193
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,500
Hello, this is Polar Bear's Café.

194
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, hello.

195
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,770
This is Panda, who you 
interviewed the other day.

196
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,150
Oh, the one who didn't pass.

197
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,700
I would like to place a delivery order.

198
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm sorry, we don't do deliveries.

199
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,510
Even though you're right next door?

200
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,510
Not to mention we're 
quite busy right now.

201
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,330
Aww...

202
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,600
What would it take for 
you to make a delivery?

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,830
Hey.

204
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,830
Oh, hi, Mom.

205
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,610
Lying around again...

206
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,040
I was looking for a job.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,320
Come on, you're right next door, 
so make a delivery.

208
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,530
Please?

209
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,430
Waah, please don't suck me up!

210
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
Hello.

211
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,390
Hello.

212
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,610
What would you like?

213
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,000
What would you like, Mr. Penguin?

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,410
Let's see...

215
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,140
I'll have the usual.

216
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,070
I'll have the usual!

217
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,290
What?!

218
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,750
Usual

219
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,210
He asked for...

220
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,070
the usual.

221
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,290
Leave it to me.

222
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,210
Here's your curry rice.

223
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,050
Apparently that wasn't it.

224
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,200
I knew it.

225
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,430
Hey, now...

226
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,430
Excuse me,

227
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,530
do you not have any bamboo 
or bamboo grass?

228
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,480
We do not.

229
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,300
Then could I get an iced coffee?

230
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,440
You were looking for a 
part-time job, weren't you?

231
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,950
They have something like this:

232
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,360
Looking for tuna boat crewmen!

233
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,820
We will gladly accept 
those with experience!

234
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,370
Intense physical labor!

235
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,460
How about it?

236
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,370
No way!  Not to mention, I can't swim!

237
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,880
I think this one is better.

238
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,340
The zoo is accepting applicants 
without experience.

239
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
We will gladly accommodate work days.

240
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,910
"Please give us a call.

241
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
The Petting Zoo."

242
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,930
You should totally go 
with the tuna boat.

243
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,350
Mr. Polar Bear...

244
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,320
The zoo, huh?  That sounds fun!

245
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,610
Let's see, so you're looking to 
work two days a week?

246
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,770
Yes.

247
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,700
Then would you be interested in 
the position of "panda"?

248
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,200
Huh?

249
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,690
We have one full-time panda,

250
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,840
but we're also looking to 
fill a part-time slot.

251
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,280
When you say "panda," you do 
mean <i>that</i> panda, right?

252
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,110
Are you not interested?

253
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,500
In that case, we are looking for

254
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,010
an Asian black bear and a gorilla.

255
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,070
I'll take the panda position.

256
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,350
I see.  Then please begin 
coming next week.

257
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,510
I found a part-time job.

258
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,210
Really?  That's great to hear!

259
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,070
The tuna boat?

260
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,670
No way.  The zoo.

261
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,200
What part-time job are you 
going to be doing at the zoo?

262
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,000
It's a secret.

263
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,640
Why are you so embarrassed?

264
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,860
Today's the day I start 
my part-time job.

265
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm so excited.

266
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,780
Hello again, my name is Handa.

267
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,220
We will have some preschool 
visitors today.

268
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,980
Please give them a 
little extra service.

269
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,680
Okay!

270
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,790
Service, huh?  You got it.

271
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,800
What should I be doing 
the rest of the time?

272
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,550
Just act naturally.

273
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,190
Hey, Polar Bear.

274
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,760
How do you think Panda's doing?

275
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,910
I'm sure he'll get a huge 
haul on the tuna boat.

276
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,940
You're not letting go of that, are you?

277
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh, could I get a café mocha?

278
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,260
Um...

279
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,370
That would be a 
body double <i>(kagemusha)</i>.

280
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,410
Honestly, you don't have to do that.

281
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,890
Really?  Seven days a week?

282
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,690
You don't have a day off?

283
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,140
Well, I am a full-time panda.

284
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,630
But I do take about two 
days off a month.

285
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm so glad I'm part-time.

286
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,250
Well, it'll be a pleasure 
working with you.

287
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,380
Same here.

288
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,190
Oh, by the way...

289
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,840
What's the matter?

290
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,360
Mr. Handa was saying...

291
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,820
...naturally.

292
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,350
is how I should act.

293
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,780
I see.

294
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,740
Is it something like this?

295
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,310
Does this look like I'm one with nature?

296
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,150
I don't think that's what he meant.

297
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,210
Or rather, that's very unnatural.

298
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,010
Well, you don't have to worry so much.

299
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,790
Just act like normal and you'll be fine.

300
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,010
Oh...

301
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,650
Ooh, pandas!

302
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,200
Look, children, pandas!

303
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,150
Oh, looks like the preschool 
kids are here.

304
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,910
Let's give it our best.

305
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,650
O-Okay!

306
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,370
Look, the pandas are eating!

307
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,640
They sure are.

308
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,800
Look, the pandas are 
playing on the slide!

309
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,180
Yes, they are.

310
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,520
Look, the pandas are rolling around!

311
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,940
Aren't they.

312
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,060
Is this what they consider service?

313
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,350
It's just for a little while longer.

314
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,440
All right, let's give it one more go!

315
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,510
A-All right!

316
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,530
Service, service...

317
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,480
Service, service...

318
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,810
Okay, everyone.  
Let's go see the giraffes next.

319
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,340
Okay!

320
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,890
Right this way.

321
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,890
Service, service...

322
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,190
Service, service...

323
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,230
Service, service...

324
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,200
I totally fell asleep.

325
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,270
Why didn't you wake me up, 
Mr. Full-Time Panda?

326
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,130
<i>The zoo will now be closing.

327
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,380
<i>Please come again.

328
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,600
Thank you for all your hard work today.

329
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,070
See you later!

330
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,460
Oh, hey, Panda.

331
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,030
Oh, you're all here?

332
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,930
Do you all know each other?

333
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,210
We're working part-time 
at the zoo, as well.

334
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,650
Hey, Panda!  Over here!

335
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,320
The preschool kids were so cute today.

336
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,490
I over-exerted myself and passed out.

337
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,180
I can totally relate.

338
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,400
I worked so hard today.

339
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,300
Indeed, you did.

340
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,310
He looks so satisfied with himself,

341
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,700
I feel so fulfilled.

342
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,870
but apparently he slept half the time.

343
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,630
I know where you're coming from.

344
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,190
I guess that's "acting naturally" to him.

345
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,620
Panda's pretty shameless, isn't he?

346
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,000
Why don't you order something, Panda?

347
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,560
Let's see...

348
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,580
Huh?

351
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,960
What can I get for you?

352
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,520
Bamboo, please! 
A large serving <i>(oomori)</i>!

353
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,400
Polar Bear, that's a gecko <i>(yamori)</i>.

354
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,050
Oh, there there.

355
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,260
That would be babysitting <i>(komori)</i>.

356
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,380
Miss Sasako retorted!

357
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,850
That would be harmonizing <i>(hamori)</i>.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,490
Hey, can I get my bamboo, already?

359
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:24,610
Next Time

360
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,210
Mr. Penguin, Mr. Penguin!

361
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,830
What do you think I'd look like 
if I shaved off all my hair?

362
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,470
This isn't the time. We're supposed 
to be doing the preview.

363
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,630
Then could you tell me three 
bad traits about yourself?

364
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,050
Let's not do that either, 
it'll bring the mood down.

365
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,470
Say something, Polar Bear.

366
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,360
Mr. Penguin's bad trait

367
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,680
is that he's bad with money.

368
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,490
Stop it!  Just finish already.

369
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,330
Okay.
