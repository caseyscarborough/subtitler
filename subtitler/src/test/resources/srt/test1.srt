00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,990
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

674
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:36,993
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

675
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:38,912
duty calls. (NERVOUS LAUGH)

676
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:48,755
- HELEN: Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

677
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,343
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

678
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:56,012
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

679
00:46:56,096 --> 00:47:00,266
- So much.
- I love you, too.

680
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:15,365
SHIP'S COMPUTER:
This is your automated Captain.

681
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:18,618
Would you care for more mimosa?

682
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,871
- BOB: Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

683
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:28,169
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

684
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:37,887
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

685
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:05,915
MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

686
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,291
Thanks.

687
00:48:07,376 --> 00:48:10,128
Nice to be back, Mirage.

688
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:39,657
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

689
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:43,161
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

690
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:44,746
See you there.

691
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:18,696
(GASPS) Edna.

692
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,657
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- E: This is Edna.

693
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:24,452
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

694
00:49:24,536 --> 00:49:27,789
Helen Parr? You know...

695
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:29,999
Elastigirl?

696
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:34,337
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

697
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,172
(STAMMERING) It's been a while.

698
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:37,715
There's only one person
Bob would trust

699
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,509
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

700
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:41,552
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

701
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,806
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

702
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,391
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

703
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:49,560
- HELEN: I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

704
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:51,145
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

705
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:53,856
No, I'm calling about suit.

706
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:56,692
(STAMMERING) Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

707
00:49:56,777 --> 00:50:00,571
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

708
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:15,086
Hmm.

709
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:21,008
(CREAKING)

710
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,312
SYNDROME: It's bigger!

711
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:36,691
It's badder!

712
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:43,281
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

713
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:47,076
It's finally ready.

714
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:51,539
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

715
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:55,084
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

716
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:59,172
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

717
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,341
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

718
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:06,596
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

719
00:51:08,056 --> 00:51:11,184
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

720
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,020
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

721
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:17,565
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

722
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:20,902
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

723
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:23,654
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

724
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:27,491
SYNDROME: It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

725
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:29,535
You can't count on anyone.

726
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:31,537
Especially your heroes.

727
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:34,916
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,419
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

729
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:39,962
That's the way it works.

730
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,798
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

731
00:51:42,883 --> 00:51:45,468
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

732
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:48,137
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

733
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:52,266
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

734
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:57,146
(LAUGHING) You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

735
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,065
I can't believe it.

736
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:06,280
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

737
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,908
Am I good enough now?

738
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,994
Who's super now?

739
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,580
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

740
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,833
Oh, brilliant!

741
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:24,757
(COUGHING)

742
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:38,271
All right, try this one on for size,

(GROANING, SPUTTERING)

744
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,474
Gazerbeam.

745
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:28,821
BOB: Kronos?

746
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,851
SCANNER: Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

747
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,567
E: This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

748
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:10,905
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

749
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:15,284
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

750
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:17,203
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

751
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:20,831
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

752
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:24,710
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

753
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:27,088
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

754
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:30,091
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

755
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:32,259
That is why I show you my work.

756
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:34,053
That is why you are here.

757
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:42,895
Edna Mode.

758
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,648
And guest.

759
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:04,291
Come. Sit.

760
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:11,006
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

761
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:13,843
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

762
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:17,930
E: Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

763
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,933
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

764
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:25,938
E: And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

765
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:30,109
Completely bulletproof.

766
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,072
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

767
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:38,075
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

768
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,288
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

769
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:45,541
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

770
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,169
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

771
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:50,045
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

772
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:56,093
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

773
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:59,763
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

774
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:03,184
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

775
00:56:03,268 --> 00:56:08,647
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

776
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:16,572
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

777
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,699
and still retain its shape.

778
00:56:19,493 --> 00:56:21,744
Virtually indestructible,

779
00:56:22,787 --> 00:56:25,498
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

780
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:29,168
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

781
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:33,506
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

782
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,635
Well, darling? What do you think?

783
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:42,264
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

784
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:43,849
Our family is underground.

785
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:47,102
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

786
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:49,730
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

787
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:52,691
Why would he keep secrets from you?

788
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:55,402
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

789
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:59,406
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

790
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,952
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:05,579
Do you know where he is?

792
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:08,582
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

803
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:48,969
- The number I have is no good.
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.

804

What do you mean? He's on
a business trip. A company retreat.

that he is Mr. Incredible,

and you will remind him who you are!

- HELEN: Just a second.

01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:30,899
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

- Please. I'm on the phone...

- This is yours. It's specially made.

- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

At the same time. Yeah.

857
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:07,579
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

So you do know these people.

877

We have to find out what."

...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

885
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,709
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

886
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:38,086
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!
