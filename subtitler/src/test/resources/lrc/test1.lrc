[00:13.37]It's close to midnight
[00:16.13]Something evil's lurking in the dark
[00:21.42]Under the moonlight
[00:24.18]You see a sight that almost stops your heart
[00:27.46]You try to scream
[00:29.97]But terror takes the sound before you make it
[00:35.75]You start to freeze
[00:38.01]As horror looks you right between the eyes
[00:41.54]You're paralyzed
[00:43.80]'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
[00:48.34]And no one's gonna save you
[00:50.10]From the beast about to strike
[00:51.86]You know it's thriller, thriller night
[00:56.39]You're fighting for your life inside a killer
[00:59.57]Thriller tonight, yeah
[01:07.38]Ooh
[01:10.14]You hear the door slam
[01:12.67]And realize there's nowhere left to run
[01:18.21]You feel the cold hand
[01:20.98]And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
[01:24.24]You close your eyes
[01:26.76]And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
[01:32.28]But all the while
[01:34.80]You hear a creature creeping up behind
[01:38.07]You're out of time
[01:40.33]'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
[01:45.13]There ain't no second chance
[01:46.63]Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
[01:49.40]Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
[01:53.16]You're fighting for your life
[01:54.67]Inside a killer, thriller tonight
[01:59.35]Night creatures call
[02:01.11]And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
[02:07.39]There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
[02:12.83]They're open wide
[02:13.73]This is the end of your life, ooh
[02:21.03]They're out to get you
[02:23.55]There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
[02:29.09]They will possess you
[02:31.85]Unless you change that number on your dial
[02:35.12]Now is the time
[02:37.64]For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
[02:43.18]All through the night
[02:45.69]I'll save you from the terror on the screen
[02:48.96]I'll make you see
[02:51.23]That this is thriller, thriller night
[02:55.75]'Cause I can thrill you more
[02:57.26]Than any ghoul would ever dare try
[03:00.03]Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
[03:03.80]So let me hold you tight
[03:05.57]And share a killer, thriller, chiller

[03:25.83]And share a killer, thriller (Ow!)
[03:35.80]I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[03:38.32]Darkness falls across the land
[03:41.84]The midnight hour is close at hand
[03:45.60]Creatures crawl in search of blood
[03:49.12]To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
[03:53.16]And whosoever shall be found
[03:56.43]Without the soul for getting down
[04:00.20]Must stand and face the hounds of hell
[04:04.22]And rot inside a corpse's shell
[04:08.16]I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[04:09.80]Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
[04:12.31]I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)

[04:28.34]The foulest stench is in the air
[04:31.10]The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
[04:34.37]And grisly ghouls from every tomb
[04:37.64]Are closing in to seal your doom
[04:42.18]And though you fight to stay alive
[04:45.45]Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
[04:49.22]For no mere mortal can resist
[04:53.25]The evil of the thriller!
